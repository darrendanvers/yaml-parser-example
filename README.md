# My Gradle Template

An empty project to simplify creating new gradle-based projects.

1. Copy this directory to an empty project directory.
2. Remove the .git directory
3. Edit [settings.gradle](./settings.gradle) file with the name of the new project.
4. Remove the following files (they are just there to get the directory structure in git):
   * [/src/main/java/toDelete.txt](/src/main/java/toDelete.txt).
   * [/src/main/resources/toDelete.txt](/src/main/resoruces/toDelete.txt).
   * [/src/test/java/toDelete.txt](/src/test/java/toDelete.txt).
   * [/src/test/resoruces/toDelete.txt](/src/tes/resoruces/toDelete.txt).
